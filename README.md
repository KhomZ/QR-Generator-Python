This is a simple QR-Generator in python


### QR code
A QR (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) invented in 1994 by the Japanese automotive company Denso Wave. 
A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. 
In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application.
A QR code uses four standarized encoding modes:
(1. numeric
 2. alphanumeric
 3. byte/binary &
 4. kanji)
 to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used.
 
 
 The Quick Response system became popular outside the automotive industry due to its fast readability and greater storage capacity compared to standard UPC barcodes. <br>
Applications include product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing.

A QR code consists of blacke squares arranged in a square grid on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device such as a camera, and processed using Reed-Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted.<br>
The required data is then extracted from patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image.
